# Guess Who: Facial Recognition Tool

## Project Description

**Guess Who** is a facial recognition tool designed to identify individuals in images and videos by associating faces with known identities. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to train a model on the **Labeled Faces in the Wild** dataset, allowing it to recognize individuals based on labeled images. It is adaptable to new users, as it can be fine-tuned for specific faces beyond the initial dataset.

The final goal of this project is to deploy a robust facial recognition model capable of accurately identifying individuals in both photos and video feeds, with potential applications in surveillance, authentication, and social media tagging.
